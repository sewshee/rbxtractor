# rbxtractor 

Easily extract audio files from the "%localappdata%\Temp\Roblox\http" folder 

A play on rbx and extractor, not "tractor". 

Simply grab a copy of the .exe from the Releases tab and run in a place where you wish for it to save audios, it automatically creates a separate folder so you can even leave this on your desktop for example.

Note: This does **NOT** attach to modify Roblox's process/executable in any way, it simply tracks the directory Roblox downloads assets to.

# Don't trust my prebuilt binary?

Download the source code, install Visual Studio 2022, and build.
